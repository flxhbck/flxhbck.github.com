								cuboino is a tangible, digital extension for the marble-game cuboro. It consists of a set of cubes that are seamlessly compatible with the cuboro cubes. In contrast to the passive cuboro cubes, cuboino modules are active parts of a digital system consisting of sensor cubes, actor cubes and supply cubes. By snapping them together, the player can build a modular system that functions according to he individual functionalities of the cuboino cubes.

						<label for="projects-2">Sensory Fiction <span> / affective storytelling </span></label>
						<article>
							<p>
								Sensory fiction is a design fiction about future ways of experiencing and telling stories.
								<br/>
								Traditionally fiction creates and induces emotions and empathy through words and images. In a fictional future dominated by wearable technology, people suppress their physiological emotional responses, as they are being recorded and analyzed. To regain those physical symptoms of emotions, they use a vest with different actuators that trigger emotions networked with the story of the book.
								<br />
								The project is inspired by 'The Diamond Age' by Neil Stephenson, more specifically the seemingly magical book called the primer as well as the short story 'The Girl Who Was Plugged in' by James Tiptree Jr.

						<article>
							<p>
								Together with the digital agency <a href="http://meso.net/">Meso</a> I worked on two interactive pieces for Bayer Material Sciences. The goals were to present their innovative high tech rear projection material Makrofol&reg; as well as connecting visitors with the brand.
								<!--
								<br />
								We built 3 sculptural pieces, each about 9 meter long and seperatable into 4 autonomos modules. Each module had two multitouch surfaces and leap motions, allowing for precise control and playful gestural interaction. Each module also contained one ambient projector and two content projectors.

						<article>
							<p>
								WILD&amp;TAME is an artifact with its own character.
								In a playful interaction the player tries to tame the artificial entity WILD using the flexible Controller TAME.
								The shape of WILD is based on a sphere but changes during interaction, expressing the emotions of WILD.

								<br/>
								Interacting with WILD&amp;TAME does not mean controlling it but trying to tame it. It has its own character and emotions that it expresses through surface-animations, behavior and its heart-rate

						<article>
							<p>
								Metadoors is a try, to find and visualize information hidden in everyday life, something simple as a door. While everyone transfers rooms hundreds of times a week, even small information such as color or the time in which doors have been passed form a set of interesting values.
								<br/>
								It is the try to extract as much information as possible from a everyday routine. The very different visualizations and sets of doors represent a lot more information than what can be seen in a single photo. Today, a lot of these apparently meaningless actions are recorded everywhere, online or by surveillance.

							<p>
								Pneuduino is a toolkit for fast prototyping of inflatable structures. Currently  developed for workshops with kids or students of different ages, we already saw great results with novices achieving suprisingly complex results in short times.
								<br/>
								The kit has a motherboard to drive valves and pumps at its core and multiple extension boards including capacitive sensing, a gamepad and air-pressure sensing (planned).

								Klangk&ouml;rper is a kinetic machine that explores the materialization and embodiment of audio signals. With the device sound can be captured, manipulated, stored and released in realtime. The form of the artifact reveals informations about its content by visualizing the average levels through diameter changing circles.

						<article>
							<p>
								Networks are shaped, shifted, defined by movements. If we consider them as planes, they exist within certain boundaries, frontiers that separate one from one another. They are contained within edges that sometime get dull or sharpen, that sometime extend or break. A malleable matrix of push-pull dynamics, a self defined entity reviving itself continuously. Scar tissues are networks.
								<br/>
								Echo physically visualizes invisible tectonics plates : the unstable virtual ground. It's silent but far from inert. Most see it as a whole medium, as an homogeneously stable mixture of media when in fact, it react like nitroglycerin. Billion times a second. How can we render those crossings, those collisions, that noise? The same as if they would be actual earthquakes; using cross-references as signs that tectonics plates are shearing, digital movements are translated visually using a seismograph.

						<article>
							<p>
								VÄRI is the game that I built during the Global Game Jam 2013 together with my friends Julian Hespenheide, Michele Krüger, Hendrik Heuer and Sarina Walters.
								<br/>
								The theory of subtractive color mixing provides the core mechanics for VÄRI. The player is presented with towers that generate fields of colors in cyan, magenta or yellow. These fields are only activated by the heartbeat of the central tower, and only if it is in range. According to color, each field can then trigger towers of its own color, which in turn shoot the upcoming enemies. While only fields of yellow active yellow towers etc., more advanced towers demand the combination of two.
								<br/>
								With the red, green and blue towers each consisting of the combination of two, VÄRI's ultimate tower, while only as a concept, would require all fields at once, making it the black tower. Since a tower can only attack enemies of it's own color ( or a subcolor thereof ), this manifests in an approach to rethink the class system of common tower defense games.

								Aila is a sidescrolling game developed for the iPhone. At the heart of the game is the Umwelt-Theory, which describes that depending on the sensory organs of an animal, the perception of its environment changes.
								<br/>
								Sidescrolling Adventures may all look the same. Except, what really does anything look like? Alien Independent Lifeform Aila is still adapting, trying out different lifeforms on earth. Each from different environments, equipped with their own unique sensory perception.

						<article>
							<p>
								Marsh-o-matic is a "Simon Says"-like game that is played by touching, squishing but preferably eating marshmallows. After hearing a melody with each tone related to a certain marshmallow, the player has to repeat the melody by eating the marsmallows in the right order and rhythm.
								<br/>
								In a second mode the device can be used as loop station, making eating marshmallow more musical than it ever was!
