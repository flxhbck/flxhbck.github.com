    <p>
        Marsh-o-matic is a "Simon Says"-like game that is played by touching, squishing but preferably eating marshmallows. After hearing a melody with each tone related to a certain marshmallow, the player has to repeat the melody by eating the marsmallows in the right order and rhythm. 
    <p>
        In a second mode the device can be used as loop station, making eating marshmallow more musical than it ever was!     </p>
