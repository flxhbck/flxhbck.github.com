        Sensory fiction is a design fiction about future ways of experiencing and telling stories. 
		Traditionally fiction creates and induces emotions and empathy through words and images. In a fictional future dominated by wearable technology, people suppress their physiological emotional responses, as they are being recorded and analyzed. To regain those physical symptoms of emotions, they use a vest with different actuators that trigger emotions networked with the story of the book. 
		The project is inspired by 'The Diamond Age' by Neil Stephenson, more specifically the seemingly magical book called the primer as well as the short story 'The Girl Who Was Plugged in' by James Tiptree Jr.
