    <p>
        WILD&TAME is an artifact with its own character. In a playful interaction the player tries to tame the artificial entity WILD using the flexible Controller TAME. The shape of WILD is based on a sphere but changes during interaction, expressing the emotions of WILD.

    <p>
		Interacting with WILD&TAME does not mean controlling it but trying to tame it. It has its own character and emotions that it expresses through surface-animations, behavior and its heart-rate
