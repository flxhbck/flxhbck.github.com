    <h3>interpreting everyday actions</h3>

    <p>
        Metadoors is a try, to find and visualize information hidden in everyday life, something simple as a door. While everyone transfers rooms hundreds of times a week, even small information such as color or the time in which doors have been passed form a set of interesting values. 
    </p>
    <p>
		It is the try to extract as much information as possible from a everyday routine. The very different visualizations and sets of doors represent a lot more information than what can be seen in a single photo. Today, a lot of these apparently meaningless actions are recorded everywhere, online or by surveillance.
