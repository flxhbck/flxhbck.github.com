        Aila is a sidescrolling game developed for the iPhone. At the heart of the game is the Umwelt-Theory, which describes that depending on the sensory organs of an animal, the perception of its environment changes.

		Sidescrolling Adventures may all look the same. Except, what really does anything look like? Alien Independent Lifeform Aila is still adapting, trying out different lifeforms on earth. Each from different environments, equipped with their own unique sensory perception.
