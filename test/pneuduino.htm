    <p>
        Pneuduino is a toolkit for fast prototyping of inflatable structures. Currently developed for workshops with kids or students of different ages, we already saw great results with novices achieving suprisingly complex results in short times. 
        The kit has a motherboard to drive valves and pumps at its core and multiple extension boards including capacitive sensing, a gamepad and air-pressure sensing (planned).
